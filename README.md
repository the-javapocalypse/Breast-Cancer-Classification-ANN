# Breast-Cancer-Classification-ANN
Using Artificial Neural Network for classification of tumor type (Either malignant or benign) based on the features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA). You might also want to check out my kernel on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/javapocalypse/breast-cancer-classification-in-keras-using-ann/notebook).

We will train an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) using Keras to classify tumors into Malignant or Benign type, when provided with the tumor's dimensions. In the output we will have probability of tumor of belonging to either Malignant or Benign class.

The training accuracy of my model was 99.12% and final predictions were 96.49% accurate.

The code (Either jupyter notenook or python script) is well commented to understand.

## Built With

* Python 3.6
* Keras 2.1.3
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

### Dependencies

You'll can install any missing dependecy using pip, for example.
```
pip install keras
```

### Installation

Download or Clone the repo and download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/javapocalypse/breast-cancer-classification-in-keras-using-ann/data). After that, run either python script or the jupyter notebook. This ANN is trained using CPU only. If you are using GPU, feel free to add more layers or increase number of neurons.

### Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify tumor into Malignant or Benign.
